Simple Customer relationship management

This application allows you to add, edit and delete companies, add financial transactions and check the financial balance.	

The data is saved in mongooseDB

I tried to use OOP programming.

Simply frontend serving only to show the logical operations (handlebars)

Only registered users can use the database.

In the event that the user forgets the password, he can reset it and then log in with the randomly assigned password to change it back to his own.
 
The user can of course delete his data from the database.

Each user, company and transaction have their own unique id.

Add company: We provide details of the company, the employee who is responsible for contacts with the company, and the contact person for the contractor

Company details: from the list of companies, we have access to a detailed view.
From there, we have access to the transactions carried out with this company, editing and editing history, indicating which user was the last to edit.

Transaction list: We can enter transactions made with a given company. In the list 'transaction list' view, we can see a summary of financial operations with a given company.
